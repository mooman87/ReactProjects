# Project Apothic
I have a lot of experience in the healthcare industry, particularly as it relates to insurance and pharmacy. While working at a specialty pharmacy, I began to envision a way to make ordering specialty medication easier, user friendly, and cost effective. Project Apothic is a simple React app that aims to do just that.
