      "Greetings! We hope you are staying warm and that you've had a nice 2021 so far. Again, we want to extend our thanks to those that supported us in any capacity back in 2020 with it being the crazy year that it was. When it came to events, other avenues needed to be explored and like many other establishments, we down the path of virtual presentations. Even our sewing circles went online. Going virtual allowed us to extend our reach and also gave us new ideas on proceeding forward into the 2021 season. This year, there will be a few changes. For instance, instead of opening in late March as we have done in previous years, our official opening day will be April 11, 2021. (Sunday after Easter). Our house tours will then resume every Sunday from 1-4PM unless otherwise noted on our website, email list, and social media. We will continue offering virtual presentations, adding a video demo series to the agenda, and we will have limited live presentations. Our sewing circles will also remain virtual until further notice. While our Woodville Brunch Series and Teas have proven to be quite popular, we unfortunately had to be drop them from the 2020 schedule due to social distancing requirements of that time. For 2021, we have reworked these programs to be more suitable to a virtual audience. For our brunches in the first half of the 2021 season, a boxed brunch will be offered for the ticket buyer to take home and enjoy while taking in a virtual presentation. There will also be a presentation-only option for a lower ticket price. With all that said, we have the first few events for the 2021 season set in place.

      'We are off to a really fast slow start this year. It is our anniversary! We had big plans but since there is a pandemic, we had to scale it back. Most importantly we want to THANK YOU all for joining us on this amazing adventure and invite you to stick around for 20 more fun-filled years. We are OPEN! Come and visit, bring your close friends or family to see our first neon exhibition, and tune in to Netflix at home on Friday to be "Blown Away!" '
